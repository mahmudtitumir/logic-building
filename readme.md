# Logic Building with C language

## Introduction

This repository contains a problem-solving technique that can be used to approach and solve various programming problems. How did problem attempt to solving. I follow the mysirg youtube channel. The instructor saurabh shukla who is expert in this those field

## How to Use

To use this problem-solving technique, follow these steps:

1. **Read the Question or Understand the Problem**: Read and understand the problem statement thoroughly. The first step of logic building step. Most students mistake there.

2. **Make Test Case For The Problem**: Understand the problem then make your own test case.

3. **Dry and Run**: After write down your program. The program has no need to run in computer, run yourself. This pattern is called Dry and Run

## Examples

To illustrate the problem-solving technique, this repository includes examples of solving various programming problems using the technique. Each example provides a detailed explanation of the problem, the approach taken, and the code implementation.

## Question

1. write a program to print `"hello"` on the screen.
2. write a program to print sum of two numbers.
3. write a program which takes one character as input and print ASCII code.
4. write a program to calculate the area of a circle.
5. write a program to calculate average of 3 numbers.
6. write a program to print only last digit of a number.
7. write a program to swap two numbers with different logic.
8. write a program to check whether a given number is positive or negative.
9. write a program to check whether a number is even or odd.
