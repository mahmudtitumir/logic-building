# Logic Building with C language

## Introduction

This repository contains a problem-solving technique that can be used to approach and solve various programming problems. How did the problem attempt to be solved? I follow the Mysirg YouTube channel. The instructor Saurabh Shukla who is an expert in this field

## How to Use

To use this problem-solving technique, follow these steps:

1. **Read the Question or Understand the Problem**: Read and understand the problem statement thoroughly. The first step of logic building step. Most students mistakes there.

2. **Make Test Case For The Problem**: Understand the problem then make your test case.

3. **Dry and Run**: After write down your program. The program does not need to run on a computer, run it yourself. This pattern is called Dry and Run

## Examples

To illustrate the problem-solving technique, this repository includes examples of solving various programming problems using the technique. Each example provides a detailed explanation of the problem, the approach taken, and the code implementation.

## Lessons and Motivation from this Course

This course has taught me a lot about problem-solving techniques and how to approach and solve various programming problems. The course has helped me improve my problem-solving skills, learn new programming concepts, and become a better programmer.

Here are some key lessons and motivation that I have learned from this course:

-   **Lecture 06**:

    1. write your draft logic on paper. Then dry run on the code. After finding mistakes, improve the logic. Again dry run on the code with test cases. After finding solutions, write the code.
    2. The finding solution your logic, then efficient your logic/code, then reduce unnecessary steps.

-   **Lecture 08**: For the first time, following the problem is solving the question itself. This is called logic building. One day grow your logic building. This is the main key to becoming a good programmer. And grow your **confidence** and **interest** in programming.

-   **Lecture 09**: Carefully read the question. Learning does not answer the question. Learning is how to solve the question. Be patient try to solve the question yourself and Dry Run your program in every line.

-   **Lecture 10**: Regularity is very important, without regularity you can't learn anything. So, be regular and practice daily.

-   **Lecture 11**: Convert your simple question into a complex question. This is the main key to becoming a good programmer. In programming, mathematics is very important.

-   **Lecture 12**: Interviewer check how you think and how you approach the question. Advice: Ask your Interviewer about the problem/question.

-   **Lecture 13**: If your brain is trained to solve the question then your brain clicks the answer in a second. Always put your brain into uncomfortable situations to solve the question.

-   **Lecture 18**: At first time solve the question yourself. That is solving the question. Question-solving is not important, how to think and process of solving the question is important.

-   **Lecture 26**: Solution is not interesting, process of solution is interesting. It's make problem solver. The process of thinking about the problem. When you become a teacher or mentor, you remember to justify your content to the fees.

-   **Lecture 27**: The difference between the topper and you is consistency. Topper is consistent in his work. Toppers makes his weakness into a strong point. When you solve the question, you enjoy the process. Hard work -> Enjoy -> Confidence -> Consistency -> Success.

-   **Lecture 28**: when you pay for something, then you sincerely do the work. Experience: Most students are weak in those topics. There are array, string, struct, pointer

-   **Lecture 30**: Talk about skill, not money.

## Summary

This repository contains a problem-solving technique that can be used to approach and solve various programming problems. The technique involves understanding the problem, identifying the input and output requirements, and developing a step-by-step plan to solve the problem.

## Approach

To solve the problem, follow these steps:

1. Understand the Problem: Read and understand the problem statement thoroughly. Identify the input and output requirements.

2. Build your test case following the problem: Understand the problem then make your test case.

3. Dry and Run: After writing your program. The program does not need to run on the computer, run it yourself. This pattern is called Dry and Run.
    - Dry Run: Run the program in your mind, step by step, to see how it works.
    - Run: Run the program on the computer to verify that it works correctly.

To solve recursive problems, follow these steps:

1. Suppose complete the problem. Example: printNaturalNum(n) 1 2 3 4 5 6 n

    - This is called a print case.

2. Then, write a simpler version of the original problem. Example: printNaturalNum(n-1) 1 2 3 4 print(n)

    - This is called a recursive case.

3. Then, write a condition to stop the program. Example: n == 0
    - This is called base case.

## Conclusion

This repository contains a problem-solving technique that can be used to approach and solve various programming problems. The technique involves understanding the problem, identifying the input and output requirements, and developing a step-by-step plan to solve the problem.
