# Logic Building with C language

## Introduction

This repository contains a problem-solving technique that can be used to approach and solve various programming problems. How did problem attempt to solving. I follow the mysirg youtube channel. The instructor saurabh shukla who is expert in this those field

## How to Use

To use this problem-solving technique, follow these steps:

1. **Read the Question or Understand the Problem**: Read and understand the problem statement thoroughly. The first step of logic building step. Most students mistake there.

2. **Make Test Case For The Problem**: Understand the problem then make your own test case.

3. **Dry and Run**: After write down your program. The program has no need to run in computer, run yourself. This pattern is called Dry and Run

## Examples

To illustrate the problem-solving technique, this repository includes examples of solving various programming problems using the technique. Each example provides a detailed explanation of the problem, the approach taken, and the code implementation.
